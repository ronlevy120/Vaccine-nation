    <p style="line-height:250%">

The coronavirus is affecting 219 countries and territories, hitting almost every country in the
world. Hospitals are overflowing, unemployment rates are increasing and most countries are
currently in recession. In order for the corona vaccine to be effective in controlling this world
pandemic it requires herd immunity, thereby reducing the likelihood of serious illness for
individuals who lack immunity or are at high risk. The goal of this project is to identify if there is a
cluster of anti-vaccers in a country, so governments can proactively raise awareness and
educate regarding the importance of the vaccine.
