Deployment of NLP model to analyze Covid-19 related tweets 

# The Idea
The coronavirus is affecting 219 countries and territories, hitting almost every country in the world. Hospitals are overflowing, unemployment rates are increasing and most countries are currently in recession. In order for the corona vaccine to be effective in controlling this world pandemic it requires herd immunity, thereby reducing the likelihood of serious illness for individuals who lack immunity or are at high risk. The goal of this project is to identify if there is a cluster of anti-vaccers in a country, so governments can proactively raise awareness and educate regarding the importance of the vaccine.
